geonetwork-manager is a java library to interact with GeoNetwork Opensource. Its aim is to provide a simple API to create, delete, administer the catalog entries programmatically.

Status
This library has just been refactored out from a more extensive project. The supported operations at the moment are

insert metadata,
search metadata,
retrieve metadata,
update metadata,
delete metadata,
change permissions.

A requirement for this library is to depend as less as possible on external libraries. This library aims at being lean and mean.
